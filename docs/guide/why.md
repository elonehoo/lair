# Why lair

:::tip NOTE
This is a template that can quickly build SpringBoot and Vue.js projects.
It uses a full-module construction method to facilitate the reuse and refactoring of components.
:::

## Front-end module

It adopts the current very trendy technology,
has very cool HMR, and atomized css.
Using the logic of pnpm's Workspace workspace,
components and pages are separated,
tools and services are separated,
and each step is made independent.
This is the most fashionable front-end modularization.

## Backend module

The back-end also adopts the module method,
using the characteristics that Maven can inherit,
a solution that decouples each business and component,
tool and business. This will make all the codes exist independently,
and only the business will be coupled with them,
which will allow us to gradually extract our own business core.
